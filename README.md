- **Image Steganography:** Steganography is derived from two Greek words:'stegos,' which means 'to cover,' and 'grayfia,' which means 'writing,' thus translating to 'covered writing,' or 'hidden writing.' Steganography is a method of concealing sensitive information by embedding it in an audio, video, image, or text file. It is one of the techniques used to protect confidential or sensitive data from malicious attacks.
