**Image Steganography:** Steganography is derived from two Greek words:'stegos,' which means 'to cover,' and 'grayfia,' which means 'writing,' thus translating to 'covered writing,' or 'hidden writing.' Steganography is a method of concealing sensitive information by embedding it in an audio, video, image, or text file. It is one of the techniques used to protect confidential or sensitive data from malicious attacks. Image Steganography, as the name implies, is the process of concealing data within an image file. The image chosen for this purpose is referred to as the cover image, and the image obtained after steganography is referred to as the stego image.

In memory, an image is represented as a N*M (for greyscale images) or N*M*3 (for colour images) matrix, with each entry representing the intensity value of a pixel. Image steganography embeds a message into an image by changing the values of some pixels chosen by an encryption algorithm.
